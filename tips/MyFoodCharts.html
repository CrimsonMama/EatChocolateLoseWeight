        <p>Above is a picture of my actual food diary.</p>

      <div>
        <p>In the beginning I used my book to write out a whole days plan. Starting with breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks all upto my calorie limit.
          I had about 15 weekdays and 8 weekend plans. However later on as my calorie allowance decreased (alongside my weight) I changed to listing just the dinner 
          options and then seperate lists of 'Other' options to pick from. Such as a list of foods under 100 calories and a list of foods over 100 (but under 200) calories. Then each day I could easily plan 
          my food for the next day, picking from my different lists. Sometimes I would change things around a bit ON the day or sometimes just be full enough and not need all the items I was allowed. 
          As I recorded my daily food on FitBit, an app with exercise, weight and calorie options, it was easy to delete or change what I actually ate from my plan. Below is some actual daily food plans I had in the past few weeks. I show 
          these so you can see how I am still losing weight (and fat) despite my diet being not traditionlly healthy or full of salads!

                      <br>
              <p>I should also mention that I had my medical check up just after my 40th birthday and came up with a completely clean bill of health! Including my cholesterol! I was given less than 1% chance of getting
                heart disease, diabetes, cholesterol or stroke type issues over the next ten years! With the amount of chips and 'fatty' food I eat it was the cholesterol I was most concerned, and curious, 
                about.
                <br>
                  I would like to add here though that if you DO like healthier foods (alongside your sweet-tooth) please go ahead and make your diet and your journey as healthy as possible! I am not here to tell people 
                  to eat junk food. Only that if you must you CAN still lose weight!

        <h3>My Weight Record</h3>
          <img src="../project-imgs/weight-chart.png" alt="My weight chart" height=30% width=80% class="goal"/>
            <p>Even if I weighed myself more often I only recorded my weight on an online chart once a week on a Friday morning. The chart above is a screen shot of my actual chart.
                You can see how when I was just doing the 5:2 diet my weight yo-yo'd up and down. However from October when I began walking, then jogging and other exercise, my weight-loss was consistent and a loverly
                downward slope! Also note two small blips! One in December and one in April. December was of course for Christmas and April I had a three-day off-diet binge for my birthday!
                I still exercised and I was happy the pounds I put on were not too great and only set me back a week or so to get back on track!
            </p>

        <h3>Good Planning</h3>
            <img src="../project-imgs/IMG_20190601_115327.jpg" alt="cooking pots" height=30% width=80% class="goal"/>
              <p>When cooking family meals I do try to cook my portion (weighed and measured where possible) seperate. As you get used to your portion size you can just estimate. But I like knowing
                I am getting the right amount for my calculations. Above is a picture of spaghetti boiling. My portion is in the smaller saucepan to the left. I also found that on days when I was not at work, such as vacation days, I would want a dinner and lunch but as I didn't have the same 
                level of calories to use as on a weekend I had to plan two lower-calorie meals instead of my one higher calorie meal. In my food diary I made plans that covered such events! Also how to plan my calories around going to the cinema or on days when my mum wanted me to have
                lunch out with her! Your food diary can pre-plan for all events so you are not caught off guard!
              </p>

        <h3>My Favourite Chocolates!</h3>
            <img src="../project-imgs/IMG_20190601_074844.jpg" alt="chocolate" height=30% width=80% class="goal"/>
             <p>Yum yum! I just couldn't end this page without a shout out to my favourite food! Chocolate! I eat a lot less of it than I used to but I still have it daily (Turkish delight is my very special treat despite being quite high in calories!. In the above picture you can see my most frequent
              bars. What would life be without these sweet treats? Just make sure you enjoy every mouthful and be mindful when you eat! I once grabbed a naughty chocolate being given out at work as I was leaving to go home. I ate it so fast on the way to my car that I realised
                 I didn't even taste it let alone enjoyed it! A total waste of extra calories! If you are going to do it then at least sit down and enjoy it!
